{{{
Usage: boblightd [OPTION]

  options:

  -c  set the config file, default is /etc/boblight.conf
  -f  fork
}}}

Boblightd needs a config file so it knows what to do at startup, the default file it tries to open is /etc/boblight.conf, this can be changed with the -c flag, for example: "boblightd -c /home/user/boblight.conf".

By default boblight does not fork, so if you want to start it from a boot script you should use the -f flag.
