#summary Explanation of the boblight.conf config file for boblightd.

= Introduction =

[boblightd] needs a config file so it knows what to do at startup, the default file it tries to open is /etc/boblight.conf.

= Details =

boblight.conf has 4 different type of sections, [boblightconf#global [global]], [boblightconf#global [device]], [boblightconf#global [color]] and [boblightconf#global [light]].

= global =
A `[global]` section describes the interface and port to bind the listening tcp socket to, if interface is not specified boblightd will bind to all interfaces (INADDR_ANY), for safety reasons you should bind to interface 127.0.0.1 if you don't plan to use boblight over a network.

If no port is specified boblightd will bind to port 19333.

Example `[global]` section:
{{{
[global]
interface 127.0.0.1
port      19333
}}}

= device =
