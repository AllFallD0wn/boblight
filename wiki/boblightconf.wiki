#summary Explanation of the boblight.conf config file for boblightd.

= Introduction =

[boblightd] needs a config file so it knows what to do at startup, the default file it tries to open is /etc/boblight.conf.

= Details =

boblight.conf has 4 different type of sections: [boblightconf#global [global]], [boblightconf#global [device]], [boblightconf#global [color]] and [boblightconf#global [light]].

== global ==
A `[global]` section has two settings: interface and port.<br>
You can specify as many global settings as you want, although there's no point in having more than one.

Interface specifies where to bind the listening tcp socket, if interface is not specified boblightd will bind to all interfaces (INADDR_ANY) by default, for safety reasons you should bind to interface 127.0.0.1 if you don't plan to use boblight over a network.

Port specifies to which port the tcp socket will bind (who would have guessed), if no port is specified boblightd will bind to port 19333 by default.

Example `[global]` section:
{{{
[global]
interface 127.0.0.1
port      19333
}}}

== device ==

A `[device]` section specifies a device for boblightd, it has 9 settings:<br>

 * name<br>Specifies the name of the device, this setting is mandatory and must be unique (you can't have two devices with the same name).

 * type<br>Specifies the type of the device, this setting is mandatory.<br>Possible values are ltbl, momo, atmo, sound and popen.

 * output<br>Specifies where the device has its output, this setting is mandatory.<br>For ltbl, momo and atmo devices this is a serial port (/dev/ttyS0), for sound devices this is api:device (ALSA:default) and for popen devices this is something that can be executed (dd of=/dev/null).

 * channels<br>Specifies the number of channels the device has, this setting is mandatory.

 * interval<br>Specifies the iteration interval in microseconds for ltbl, momo, atmo and popen, this setting is mandatory for those devices.

 * prefix<br>Specifies a prefix in hex sent before each burst of rgb information, this setting is optional and only applies to momo devices.

 * rate<br>Specifies the baudrate for momo, atmo and ltbl devices, specifies the samplerate for sound devices, this setting is mandatory for those devices.

 * period<br>Specifies the period in samples for sound devices, in other words how many samples are written per iteration, this setting is mandatory.<br>A good value for a samplerate of 48000 is 1024, this updates the output 46.875 times per second.

 * latency<br>Specifies the latency for sound devices in microseconds, this setting is optional.<br>If this is not specified the default portaudio low output latency is used (whatever that is, it seems pretty low anyway).

Example `[device]` sections:

{{{
#ltbl device with 3 channels on /dev/ttyUSB0, baudrate of 115k2 and updated 50 times per second (20000 microseconds, 1/50 seconds).
#oh did I mention you can add comments in boblight.conf by prefixing them with #?

[device]
name 		device1
output		/dev/ttyUSB0
channels	3
type		ltbl
interval	20000
rate            115200
}}}

I'm done for the day, more info soon.
